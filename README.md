This is a simple front end webpage that has a virtual vending machine. 

It can be visited here: https://stephendoyle10.github.io/VendingMachine/

A user can click on as many drinks as they like. Each time they click on a drink, the amount required will be added to the page. When the user has selected how many drinks they want, they can start to pay by adding coins (clicking on appropriate buttons).

Once they have inserted enough money they can click on 'Buy' (this button is disabled until enough money has been entered). When clicking on 'buy' they will be told which drinks they ordered, and which coins, if any, were returned to them in change.

They can reset everything at any time with a reset button.
